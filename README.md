# Railway Network Optimization

Railway Network Optimization is a Python project that leverages graph algorithms to assist users in planning and optimizing railway routes. The project provides a user-friendly interface for inputting distances between stations, visualizing the railway network, and employing graph algorithms like Dijkstra's and Kruskal's to find the shortest paths and optimize routes efficiently.

## Features

- **Graph Input:** Create a directed railway network by specifying distances between stations.
- **Visualization:** Visualize the directed railway network graph to understand the connectivity between stations.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Find the shortest path between specific stations using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- **Kruskal's Algorithm:** Optimize routes for covering all stations efficiently using Kruskal's algorithm.
- **Centrality Visualization:** Visualize degree and betweenness centrality measures to identify important stations.
- **Graph Export/Import:** Save and load railway network graphs for further analysis.

## How to Use

1. **Input Railway Network:** Enter the number of stations and provide distances between them when prompted.
2. **Explore and Visualize:** View the directed railway network graph and explore its connectivity.
3. **Shortest Path:** Find the shortest path between specific stations using Dijkstra's algorithm.
4. **Optimize Routes:** Use Kruskal's algorithm to optimize routes for covering all stations efficiently.
5. **Centrality Measures:** Visualize degree and betweenness centrality measures to identify critical stations.
6. **Export/Import:** Save and load railway network graphs for reuse or sharing.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/railway-network-optimization.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install networkx matplotlib
   ```

3. Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python railway_network_optimization.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to input your railway network and explore optimization options.
